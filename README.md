# docker-jupyter

This image contains a Jupyter Lab server with the reproduce_work Python package installed. It is intended to be used with the [reproduce-work-cli]() tool.

After changes are made to the reproduce_work package, the image will need to be pulled.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/reproduce-work/scienv-jupyter:latest
```
